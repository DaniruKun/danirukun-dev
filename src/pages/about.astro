	<p>
		I am a Software Engineer focused on backend development at Platogo Interactive Entertainment in
		Vienna, Austria. Mostly I work with Elixir, Ruby, Go and different cloud services and data
		streaming systems. In my free time I mostly write in Elixir, Clojure and other kinds of lisps. I
		mostly enjoy doing hobby web projects, computer vision and video processing. Aside from software
		engineering, I enjoy doing photography when I have the time to do so. My goto camera is my
		Fujifilm X-H1.
