	<p>
		I am a full stack software engineer with a passion for building cool stuff on the web. I work at
		StreamElements, helping make it easier for streamers and other creators to get fame and fortune.
		I've worked on everything from video streaming, to internal web apps, to high load mobile gaming
		platforms. I'm a big fan of Elixir, TypeScript and Go, as well as 3D graphics and XR tech. In my
		free time I enjoy travelling to conventions and doing photography. I also love to play video
		games on stream, and also learning about Japanese culture and fashion.
