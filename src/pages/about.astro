	<p>
		I am a full stack software engineer with a passion for building cool stuff on the web. I work in
		game development in the beautiful city of Vienna, Austria. I've worked on everything from
		world-scale video streaming, to internal web apps, to high load mobile gaming platforms. I'm a
		big fan of Elixir and TypeScript, as well as 3D graphics and XR tech. In my free time I enjoy
		travelling to conventions and doing photography. I also love to play video games on stream, and
		also Japanese culture.
